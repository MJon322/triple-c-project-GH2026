/* TO DO IF WE SO PLEASE:
  -- some of us should focus on making the website; do research on how to make the website and ESP32(s) talk to each other
  -- the rest of us need to work on designing the ESP32(s) code, physically constructing the system, etc.
  -- if we have time we will focus on aesthetics; functionality should come first
  -- we can use our deepspace credits to help us in debugging/coding for areas we're not knowledgeable in
  -- tutorials will be our best friend
